## Readme Outlines
> ### How to run it
 * It was an amazing thing to implement and to use my ruby skills and polish them based on the requirement.
 * I also enjoyed working to meet the deadlines and make necessary improvements as well.
> ### What you would do with it if you had more time:
  * I would have added different coloring for each responses based on the result whether it's success or failure, I would show them in different colors.
  * I would have added JS and Bootstrap with it to make it more user friendly and to have better user experience.
  * I would have added the logic on backend and would have added Database to store data as well and can retrieve them from an end point which will be called from front end JS, so each time we won't be needing to calculate for huge prime numbers and we can save lots of time.
